## Abstract

Swift 6 introduced noncopyable types (`~Copyable`) enabling move-only semantics for the first time in the language's history. This capability opens new possibilities for resource management but creates a fundamental tension with Swift's existing collection protocols, which implicitly require copyability. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the design space for container types that must support both noncopyable elements (for resource safety) and copyable elements (for standard library protocol conformance). Through systematic empirical investigation, we demonstrate that a unified architecture using class-backed storage with Copy-on-Write semantics can achieve both goals with minimal overhead. We analyze Swift's internal `ManagedBuffer` primitive, examine the theoretical foundations of conditional protocol conformance, and present a complete implementation that enables `Sequence` conformance for copyable element types while maintaining zero-copy semantics for noncopyable elements. Our findings establish that the apparent overhead of class-backed storage for noncopyable containers is effectively zero at runtime, as the Copy-on-Write machinery never activates when the container itself cannot be copied.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The introduction of noncopyable types in Swift through SE-0390 [1] and SE-0427 [2] represents a paradigm shift in the language's approach to resource management. Prior to these proposals, all Swift types were implicitly copyable—any value could be duplicated at will, with the compiler automatically generating copy operations. While this simplifying assumption enabled Swift's celebrated value semantics, it also precluded certain patterns essential for systems programming: unique ownership of file descriptors, exclusive access to hardware resources, and linear types that must be consumed exactly once.

The `~Copyable` constraint suppression syntax allows types to opt out of automatic copyability:

```swift
struct FileDescriptor: ~Copyable {
    private let fd: CInt
    deinit { close(fd) }
}
```

This capability immediately raises a question for container type designers: should containers like `Stack`, `Deque`, or `Queue` support noncopyable elements? The answer appears straightforward—yes, to maximize utility. However, the implementation reveals a fundamental tension in Swift's type system that this paper addresses.

### 1.2 The Fundamental Tension

Swift's standard library collection protocols—`Sequence`, `Collection`, `RandomAccessCollection`—were designed before noncopyable types existed. These protocols implicitly require that conforming types be `Copyable`. This requirement is not explicit in the protocol definitions but inherited through Swift's default conformance rules: all types conform to `Copyable` unless explicitly suppressed.

Consider a generic `Stack` type designed to hold noncopyable elements:

```swift
struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    // ... implementation
}
```

Attempting to conform this type to `Sequence` produces a compiler error:

```
error: type 'Stack<Element>' does not conform to protocol 'Copyable'
note: type 'Stack<Element>' does not conform to inherited protocol 'Copyable'
```

The error reveals that `Sequence` itself requires `Copyable` conformance from its conforming types. This creates an apparent dichotomy: containers can either support noncopyable elements *or* conform to standard library protocols, but not both.

### 1.3 Research Questions

This paper investigates three primary research questions:

**RQ1:** Can a single container type support both noncopyable elements (with move-only semantics) and copyable elements (with `Sequence` conformance)?

**RQ2:** What is the overhead, if any, of a unified architecture compared to specialized implementations?

**RQ3:** What implementation patterns from Swift's standard library can inform the design of such containers?

### 1.4 Contributions

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. **Empirical demonstration** that conditional `Copyable` conformance enables `Sequence` conformance while maintaining noncopyable element support
2. **Analysis of the overhead characteristics** showing that class-backed storage imposes effectively zero runtime cost for noncopyable elements
3. **A method shadowing technique** that provides transparent Copy-on-Write semantics without API bifurcation
4. **Documentation of Swift compiler behaviors** regarding `~Copyable` constraint propagation in extensions
5. **A complete reference implementation** using `ManagedBuffer` that matches Swift's internal `Array` architecture

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Noncopyable Types in Swift

Swift's noncopyable types emerged through a series of Swift Evolution proposals spanning 2023-2024:

**SE-0390: Noncopyable Structs and Enums** [1] introduced the foundational concept, allowing types to declare themselves as noncopyable using the `~Copyable` syntax. This proposal established that noncopyable types:
- Cannot be implicitly copied
- Must be explicitly consumed or borrowed
- Can have `deinit` blocks for cleanup (structs and enums)
- Cannot appear in generic contexts (a limitation later lifted)

**SE-0377: Parameter Ownership Modifiers** [3] introduced `consuming`, `borrowing`, and `inout` parameter annotations, enabling explicit control over value lifetime at call sites.

**SE-0427: Noncopyable Generics** [2] extended the noncopyable system to generic contexts, introducing the `Copyable` protocol and establishing that all types conform to it by default. The `~Copyable` syntax was redefined as *suppression* of this default conformance.

**SE-0437: Noncopyable Standard Library Primitives** [4] began adapting the standard library, focusing on `Optional`, `Result`, and unsafe pointer types. Notably, this proposal explicitly deferred container type adaptation to future work.

### 2.2 Copy-on-Write in Swift

Copy-on-Write (CoW) is Swift's fundamental optimization for value types with reference-semantic storage [5]. The pattern enables value semantics (independent copies) while deferring actual copying until mutation:

```swift
var array1 = [1, 2, 3]
var array2 = array1  // No copy yet; both share storage
array2.append(4)     // Copy triggered; arrays now independent
```

The standard library provides `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:)` [6] to detect shared storage:

```swift
mutating func ensureUnique() {
    if !isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&storage) {
        storage = storage.copy()
    }
}
```

This function returns `true` when the given class instance has exactly one strong reference, indicating that mutation is safe without copying.

### 2.3 ManagedBuffer Architecture

`ManagedBuffer<Header, Element>` [7] is Swift's primitive for building custom buffer-backed collections. It combines a typed header with contiguous element storage in a single heap allocation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Object Header (isa, refcount)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Header (user-defined metadata)                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Element[0]                                      │
│ Element[1]                                      │
│ ...                                             │
│ Element[capacity-1]                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This layout provides several advantages over separate allocations:
- Single allocation/deallocation operation
- Improved cache locality
- Reduced memory fragmentation
- Natural CoW semantics through reference counting

Swift's `Array` uses a similar internal architecture through `_ContiguousArrayBuffer` and `__ContiguousArrayStorageBase` [8], though with additional complexity for Objective-C bridging.

### 2.4 Related Language Features

**Rust's Ownership System:** Rust's ownership model [9] provides compile-time enforcement of unique ownership without runtime overhead. Rust containers like `Vec<T>` can hold non-`Copy` types natively, as Rust's trait system doesn't impose a universal copyability requirement.

**C++ Move Semantics:** C++11 introduced move semantics [10] enabling efficient transfer of resources. Unlike Swift, C++ allows types to be both copyable and movable, with move operations taking precedence when applicable.

**Linear Types:** The theoretical foundation for noncopyable types comes from linear type systems [11], where values must be used exactly once. Swift's `~Copyable` implements an *affine* variant where values may be used at most once.

---

## 3. Problem Analysis

### 3.1 The Copyability Requirement Chain

To understand why `Sequence` conformance fails for `~Copyable` containers, we must trace the requirement chain:

1. `Sequence` is defined as a protocol with no explicit `Copyable` constraint
2. However, all protocol conforming types inherit `Copyable` by default (per SE-0427)
3. The `Sequence` protocol itself has not been updated with `~Copyable` suppression
4. Therefore, `extension MyType: Sequence` requires `MyType: Copyable`

This reveals that the barrier is not in `Sequence`'s explicit requirements but in Swift's default conformance rules applied to pre-SE-0427 protocols.

### 3.2 The Deinit Constraint

A container holding noncopyable elements must ensure proper cleanup. In Swift, this requires a `deinit` block:

```swift
struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    private var storage: UnsafeMutablePointer<Element>
    private var count: Int

    deinit {
        for i in 0..<count {
            (storage + i).deinitialize(count: 1)
        }
        storage.deallocate()
    }
}
```

However, Swift imposes a critical constraint: **structs with `deinit` cannot be conditionally `Copyable`**. The compiler rejects:

```swift
extension Stack: Copyable where Element: Copyable {}
// error: deinitializer cannot be declared in struct that conforms to 'Copyable'
```

This creates an apparent impossibility: containers needing cleanup cannot be copyable, and non-copyable containers cannot conform to `Sequence`.

### 3.3 Hypothesis: Class-Backed Storage

Our hypothesis is that delegating resource management to a backing class resolves the deinit constraint:

```swift
final class StackStorage<Element: ~Copyable> {
    // ... storage management
    deinit { /* cleanup */ }
}

struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    private var _storage: StackStorage<Element>
    // No deinit needed—class handles cleanup
}
```

Since the struct no longer has a `deinit`, it can potentially be conditionally `Copyable`. The backing class handles resource cleanup through its own `deinit`, which is unaffected by the struct's copyability.

---

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Experimental Framework

We employed the Swift Institute's Experiment Package methodology [12], creating minimal reproduction packages in isolated environments to test specific hypotheses. Each experiment:

1. Declares a specific hypothesis
2. Implements a minimal reproduction case
3. Records compiler output and runtime behavior
4. Documents the toolchain version (Swift 6.2.3)

### 4.2 Experiment Design

**Experiment 1: Baseline Failure**
Hypothesis: A `~Copyable` struct cannot directly conform to `Sequence`.

**Experiment 2: Conditional Copyable with Deinit**
Hypothesis: A struct with `deinit` cannot be conditionally `Copyable`.

**Experiment 3: Class-Backed Conditional Copyable**
Hypothesis: A struct holding a class reference can be conditionally `Copyable`.

**Experiment 4: Value Semantics Verification**
Hypothesis: Naive class-backing breaks value semantics (shared storage).

**Experiment 5: Copy-on-Write Correctness**
Hypothesis: Adding CoW restores correct value semantics.

**Experiment 6: Method Shadowing**
Hypothesis: Extension methods can shadow base methods based on generic constraints.

**Experiment 7: ManagedBuffer Integration**
Hypothesis: `ManagedBuffer` can hold `~Copyable` elements while enabling conditional `Copyable`.

### 4.3 Metrics

We measured:
- **Compilation success/failure** with exact error messages
- **Runtime correctness** through assertion-based tests
- **Memory layout** using `MemoryLayout<T>.size`
- **Allocation count** through structured lifecycle observation

---

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Experiment 1: Baseline Failure Confirmed

```swift
struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    // ... implementation with deinit
}

extension Stack: Sequence {
    // ...
}
```

**Result:** Compiler error confirming hypothesis:
```
error: type 'Stack<Element>' does not conform to protocol 'Copyable'
note: type 'Stack<Element>' does not conform to inherited protocol 'Copyable'
```

### 5.2 Experiment 2: Deinit Blocks Conditional Copyable

```swift
struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    deinit { /* cleanup */ }
}

extension Stack: Copyable where Element: Copyable {}
```

**Result:** Compiler error:
```
error: deinitializer cannot be declared in generic struct that conforms to 'Copyable'
```

This confirms that the `deinit` requirement for cleanup fundamentally conflicts with conditional `Copyable` conformance.

### 5.3 Experiment 3: Class-Backed Conditional Copyable Succeeds

```swift
final class StackStorage<Element: ~Copyable> {
    var buffer: UnsafeMutablePointer<Element>
    deinit { /* cleanup */ }
}

struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    private var _storage: StackStorage<Element>
}

extension Stack: Copyable where Element: Copyable {}  // ✓ Compiles
extension Stack: Sequence where Element: Copyable {}  // ✓ Compiles
```

**Result:** Both extensions compile successfully. The class holds the `deinit`; the struct can be conditionally `Copyable`.

### 5.4 Experiment 4: Value Semantics Initially Broken

```swift
var stack1 = Stack<Int>()
stack1.push(1); stack1.push(2); stack1.push(3)
var stack2 = stack1  // Copy struct (copies reference)
stack2.push(4)
print(stack1.count)  // Expected: 3, Actual: 4 ❌
```

**Result:** Both stacks share storage. Mutations affect both. Value semantics violated.

### 5.5 Experiment 5: Copy-on-Write Restores Correctness

```swift
extension Stack where Element: Copyable {
    private mutating func makeUnique() {
        if !isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&_storage) {
            _storage = _storage.copy()
        }
    }

    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        makeUnique()
        // ... push implementation
    }
}
```

**Result:**
```
stack1.count = 3  // ✓ Original unchanged
stack2.count = 4  // ✓ Copy independent
```

Value semantics correctly restored through CoW.

### 5.6 Experiment 6: Method Shadowing Works

We defined base methods on the `~Copyable` struct and shadowing methods in a `where Element: Copyable` extension:

```swift
struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    // Base: no CoW (for ~Copyable elements)
    mutating func push(_ element: consuming Element) { ... }
}

extension Stack where Element: Copyable {
    // Shadow: CoW-aware (selected when Element: Copyable)
    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        makeUnique()
        // ... same implementation
    }
}
```

**Result:** Compiler selects the correct method based on `Element`'s copyability:
- `Stack<Int>`: Uses shadowing CoW method
- `Stack<UniqueResource>`: Uses base non-CoW method

### 5.7 Experiment 7: ManagedBuffer Optimization

Replacing the custom class with `ManagedBuffer`:

```swift
final class OptimizedStorage<Element: ~Copyable>: ManagedBuffer<Int, Element> {
    static func create(minimumCapacity: Int) -> OptimizedStorage<Element> {
        let storage = OptimizedStorage.create(minimumCapacity: minimumCapacity) { _ in 0 }
        return unsafeDowncast(storage, to: OptimizedStorage.self)
    }

    deinit {
        withUnsafeMutablePointerToElements { elements in
            for i in 0..<header {
                (elements + i).deinitialize(count: 1)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Result:** Compiles and functions correctly with both copyable and noncopyable elements.

### 5.8 Memory Layout Analysis

| Configuration | Struct Size | Heap Allocations | Cache Locality |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Inline storage (current) | 24 bytes | 1 (elements) | Indirect |
| Separate class + buffer | 8 bytes | 2 | Poor |
| ManagedBuffer | 8 bytes | 1 | Excellent |

The `ManagedBuffer` approach matches inline storage's allocation count while providing superior cache locality through contiguous header+element storage.

## 6. Analysis and Discussion

### 6.1 The Zero-Overhead Principle for Noncopyable Elements

A critical insight emerged from our experiments: **when `Element: ~Copyable`, the CoW machinery imposes zero runtime overhead**.

This follows from a simple observation: if `Element` is noncopyable, then `Stack<Element>` is also noncopyable (it contains noncopyable elements). A noncopyable stack cannot be copied. Therefore:

1. `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&_storage)` always returns `true`
2. The copy branch in `makeUnique()` is never taken
3. No CoW copies ever occur

The only overhead is the class allocation itself (~48 bytes for `ManagedBuffer` metadata). For containers holding multiple elements, this overhead is negligible.

### 6.2 Why Method Shadowing Works

Swift's overload resolution prefers more specific signatures. When `Element: Copyable`, both methods are available:

```swift
func push(_ element: consuming Element)  // Base
func push(_ element: Element)            // Extension where Element: Copyable
```

The extension method is more specific because it applies to a subset of `Element` types. Swift selects it when applicable.

When `Element: ~Copyable` (and not also `Copyable`), only the base method is available. No ambiguity arises.

This technique enables **transparent API design**: users call `push(_:)` without knowing which implementation runs.

### 6.3 Comparison with Swift's Array

Swift's `Array<Element>` uses a similar architecture [8]:

| Aspect | Array | Our Stack |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Storage class | `__ContiguousArrayStorageBase` | `ManagedBuffer` subclass |
| Header | `_SwiftArrayBodyStorage` | `Int` (count) |
| CoW primitive | `isKnownUniquelyReferenced` | Same |
| Copyable elements only | Yes | No—supports both |

The key difference: `Array` requires `Element: Copyable` because it predates SE-0427. Our architecture demonstrates that this requirement is *not* fundamental to the CoW pattern.

### 6.4 Why Swift's Sequence Requires Copyable

The `Sequence` protocol's implicit `Copyable` requirement exists because:

1. `Sequence.Iterator` is typically a value type that must be copyable
2. The `for-in` loop creates a copy of the iterator
3. Historical API design assumed universal copyability

A future `Sequence: ~Copyable` variant would need to address iterator lifecycle. Our workaround—providing `Sequence` conformance only when `Element: Copyable`—sidesteps this by ensuring the container itself is copyable when iteration is needed.

### 6.5 The Three Design Paths

Our research reveals three distinct architectural paths for container primitives:

**Path 1: Pure ~Copyable (Inline Storage)**
- Struct with `deinit` manages storage directly
- Cannot be conditionally `Copyable`
- No `Sequence` conformance possible
- Provides `forEach(_:)` with borrowing closure as alternative
- Minimum overhead

**Path 2: Unified (Class-Backed with CoW)**
- Struct holds class reference; class has `deinit`
- Conditionally `Copyable` when `Element: Copyable`
- `Sequence` conformance when `Element: Copyable`
- `~Copyable` behavior when `Element: ~Copyable`
- One allocation overhead

**Path 3: Always Copyable (Traditional)**
- Standard value semantics throughout
- Full `Sequence`/`Collection` conformance
- Cannot hold `~Copyable` elements
- Simplest implementation

The choice depends on priorities. Path 2 provides the broadest capability with minimal overhead.

## 7. Implementation

### 7.1 Complete Reference Implementation

We present a complete implementation following the unified architecture:

```swift
// MARK: - Storage

final class StackStorage<Element: ~Copyable>: ManagedBuffer<Int, Element> {

    static func create() -> StackStorage<Element> {
        let storage = StackStorage.create(minimumCapacity: 0) { _ in 0 }

    }

    }
}

### 7.2 API Summary

| Element Constraint | Available APIs |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `~Copyable` | `push`, `pop`, `peek(_:)`, `forEach(_:)`, `count`, `isEmpty`, `capacity` |
| `Copyable` | All above + `Sequence` conformance + `peek() -> Element?` |

The API gracefully degrades: noncopyable elements receive full functionality except `Sequence`. Copyable elements receive standard Swift collection ergonomics.

---

## 8. Limitations and Future Work

### 8.1 Current Limitations

**Protocol Conformance Granularity:** The current design provides `Sequence` conformance only when `Element: Copyable`. A future Swift version with `Sequence: ~Copyable` could enable iteration over noncopyable elements directly.

**Extension Constraint Propagation:** We discovered that Swift 6.2 does not automatically propagate `~Copyable` constraints to extensions. Each extension on a `~Copyable` type must explicitly declare `where Element: ~Copyable` or the constraint is silently replaced with `where Element: Copyable`. This is documented behavior but surprising to many developers.

**Collection Conformance:** While `Sequence` conformance is achievable, full `Collection` conformance requires additional work around subscript semantics for noncopyable elements.

### 8.2 Future Directions

**Standard Library Evolution:** Future Swift Evolution proposals may adapt `Sequence` and `Collection` to support `~Copyable` conformers. Our architecture would benefit immediately, gaining protocol conformance without modification.

**Borrowing Iterators:** A hypothetical borrowing iterator pattern could enable iteration over noncopyable elements:

```swift
// Hypothetical future Swift
protocol BorrowingSequence: ~Copyable {
    associatedtype Element: ~Copyable
    func forEach(_ body: (borrowing Element) -> Void)

**Inline Storage with Conditional Copyable:** A future Swift compiler feature might allow conditional `deinit` based on generic constraints, enabling inline storage with conditional copyability:

```swift
// Hypothetical
struct Stack<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable {
    deinit where Element: ~Copyable { /* cleanup */ }
    // No deinit when Element: Copyable
}
```

## 9. Conclusion

This paper has demonstrated that Swift's type system, while imposing significant constraints on noncopyable container design, permits a unified architecture achieving both move-only semantics and standard library protocol conformance. Through systematic experimentation, we established:

1. **Class-backed storage with Copy-on-Write** enables conditional `Copyable` conformance
2. **Method shadowing** provides transparent CoW without API bifurcation
3. **The overhead for noncopyable elements is effectively zero** because CoW never triggers
4. **ManagedBuffer** provides an optimal foundation matching Swift's internal patterns

The apparent tension between noncopyable elements and `Sequence` conformance resolves into a design choice with clear tradeoffs. The unified architecture sacrifices minimal performance (one allocation) to gain maximum flexibility (both noncopyable support and protocol conformance).

As Swift's ownership system continues to evolve, we anticipate future proposals will further reduce these tradeoffs. Until then, the patterns documented here provide a path forward for container library authors seeking to support Swift 6's full ownership capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the existing collection ecosystem.

## Appendix A: Compiler Behavior Documentation

### A.1 Extension Constraint Propagation

When extending a type with `~Copyable` generic parameters, Swift 6.2 does not propagate the constraint suppression:

```swift
struct Container<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable { }

// INCORRECT: Implicit `where Element: Copyable` added
extension Container {
    func method() { }  // Only available when Element: Copyable
}

// CORRECT: Explicit constraint suppression
extension Container where Element: ~Copyable {
    func method() { }  // Available for all Element types
}
```

This behavior differs from standard protocol conformance constraints (like `Sendable`), which do propagate through extensions.

### A.2 Classes Cannot Be ~Copyable

Attempting to mark a class as `~Copyable` produces a compiler error:

```swift
final class Storage<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable { }
// error: classes cannot be '~Copyable'
```

Classes are reference types; copying a reference is always valid. The class *contents* may be noncopyable, but the reference itself cannot be.

### A.3 Nested Types in Extensions

Nested types declared in extensions do not properly inherit `~Copyable` constraints from their outer type:

```swift
struct Outer<Element: ~Copyable>: ~Copyable { }

extension Outer {
    // BUG: Nested doesn't properly see Element: ~Copyable
    struct Nested<let capacity: Int>: ~Copyable { }
}
```

Workaround: Declare nested types in the primary type definition, not in extensions.

## Appendix B: Performance Measurements

### B.1 Allocation Overhead

| Configuration | Allocations per Stack | Bytes Overhead |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Inline storage | 1 | 0 |
| Separate class | 2 | ~48 |
| ManagedBuffer | 1 | ~16-24 |

### B.2 Operation Costs

| Operation | Inline | ManagedBuffer | Difference |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| push (unique) | O(1) | O(1) | +1 refcount check |
| push (shared) | N/A | O(n) | CoW copy |
| pop | O(1) | O(1) | +1 refcount check |
| iteration | O(n) | O(n) | None |

For noncopyable elements, the "shared" case never occurs, making `ManagedBuffer` performance equivalent to inline storage plus one refcount check per mutation.
